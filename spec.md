# Software Design Specification Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this software is to allow a user to enter a list of tasks via a simple desktop GUI and print each task individually on an 80mm receipt printer (RONGTA brand). Each printout will contain a single task along with a timestamp and will be printed on a separate piece of receipt paper.

### 1.2 Scope
This utility is intended for use on Windows systems with USB-connected receipt printers. It is a lightweight Python application that discards tasks on exit, and focuses on quick, formatted printing of task items.

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms
- GUI: Graphical User Interface
- USB: Universal Serial Bus
- RONGTA: A brand of thermal receipt printers
- Win32 API: Windows API interface used for printer communication

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Description
The system will:
- Accept user-entered task descriptions via GUI
- Display a list of pending tasks
- Print each task individually to a RONGTA 80mm receipt printer upon user request
- Include a timestamp on each receipt
- Clear task list after printing

### 2.2 System Environment
- OS: Windows 10 or higher
- Language: Python 3.11+
- Libraries: Tkinter (GUI), win32print (printing), datetime (timestamping)
- Hardware: USB-connected 80mm RONGTA thermal receipt printer

## 3. Functional Requirements
- FR-01: The software shall allow users to enter task descriptions.
- FR-02: The software shall display the list of entered tasks.
- FR-03: The software shall provide a "Print Tasks" button to initiate printing.
- FR-04: The software shall print each task on a separate receipt.
- FR-05: Each printed receipt shall include the task description and timestamp.
- FR-06: The software shall clear the task list after printing.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR-01: The software shall launch in under 2 seconds.
- NFR-02: The user interface shall be simple and intuitive.
- NFR-03: The software shall gracefully handle printer errors and notify the user.
- NFR-04: The software shall not retain task data between sessions.

## 5. User Stories
- US-01: As a user, I want to enter tasks quickly using a text field and button.
- US-02: As a user, I want to see the list of tasks before printing.
- US-03: As a user, I want to print all tasks with one button press.
- US-04: As a user, I want each task to print separately with a timestamp.

## 6. Interface Design

### 6.1 Task Entry GUI
- Textbox for task input
- "Add Task" button
- Listbox for displaying added tasks
- "Print Tasks" button
- "Clear All" button (optional)

### 6.2 Receipt Format
- Top: Small font timestamp (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
- Middle: Large font, centered task description

## 7. Data Specifications
- Task Description: string
- Timestamp: datetime (auto-generated on print)

## 8. Constraints and Assumptions
- The receipt printer is assumed to be correctly installed and accessible via USB.
- No task data is saved between application sessions.
- Tasks are printed in the order entered.

## 9. Acceptance Criteria
- AC-01: User can input and view tasks in the application.
- AC-02: Each task is printed individually with proper formatting.
- AC-03: Printer errors are handled and displayed appropriately.
- AC-04: Application can be packaged and run as a Windows executable.

## 10. Packaging and Deployment
- Use PyInstaller to create a standalone Windows executable
- Provide README with instructions for printer setup and troubleshooting
- Logging should capture errors and successful prints for support purposes
